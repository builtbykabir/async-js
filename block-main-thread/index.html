    <h1>Block Main Thread</h1>
    <p>
      Clicking the button runs a blocking JavaScript loop that occupies the
      browser’s main thread for about 10 seconds. While this loop is running,
      the page becomes unresponsive: the UI freezes, scrolling and text
      selection stop working, button click animations do not render, and even
      browser developer tools may feel sluggish. Once the loop finishes, the
      page becomes responsive again.
